This repository contains a few Spring projects. From basic to advance. 
The folder named 'springstart' is a 'maven-archetype-quickstart' archetype project with Spring dependencies. It has JAVA programs to manually configure and use spring bean objects using properties from the new-spring-web.xml file.
The folder named 'springwebregister' is a 'maven-archetype-webapp' archetype project with Spring dependencies. 
It is manually published on a 'Tomcat 9.0' server. It has a '<welcome-file>register.jsp</welcome-file>' which can accept user inputs and save them to a connected database table and then display 'index.jsp' page.
The folder named 'ticketBooker' is a 'maven-archetype-webapp' archetype project with Spring dependencies. 
It is manually published on a 'Tomcat 9.0' server. It is a REST api. I have tested it using Postman. Various possible operations can be found in the service package.
The folder named 'carwale' is a Spring Boot (Spring starter project). It is a REST api. The various possible operations can be found in the JAVA programs in the service package. The project is integrated with swagger for api testing.
